# kubernetes

This repository contains test and development files which I created when learning about Kubernetes.  

The [manifests](/manifests) folder contains simple kubernetes manifests which I used when learning various concepts.  The [test-environment](/test-environment/) folder contains all the scripts I used to create a kubernetes environment using Vagrant (and virtualbox) with Linux.  The [cloud](/cloud/) folder contains some cloud provider specific things, such as a script to create and destroy EKS clusters.
